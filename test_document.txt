This is a test document to verify that the encryption system can handle text files properly.

The system should now support:
- Text files (.txt)
- PDF documents (.pdf)
- Word documents (.doc, .docx)
- Excel spreadsheets (.xls, .xlsx)
- PowerPoint presentations (.ppt, .pptx)
- Images (.png, .jpg, .jpeg)

All these file types should be encrypted and decrypted properly while maintaining their original format and filename.
